### Speech Outline

Fully GPT-generated, I completely assume that. That all the energy (greatest thing I can say according to the subject of my speech) I can allow to a course which is only dedicated to discussion and nothing else.

#### **I. Introduction**

- **Attention Getter (Hook):**
   Imagine a future where clean air, sustainable energy, and affordable electricity power every home. What if the key to achieving this future is already at our disposal?
- **Context/Background Issues:**
   Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. The world is searching for reliable, low-carbon energy sources. Fossil fuels are being phased out, and renewables like solar and wind have their limitations. Nuclear energy often gets overlooked due to its controversial history.
- **Establish Credibility:**
   I’ve spent time researching both the benefits and drawbacks of nuclear energy and its potential role in mitigating climate change. My goal today is to provide a balanced yet convincing argument on why nuclear energy is a vital solution.
- **Thesis (Stance + Supporting Reasons):**
   Nuclear energy is the best solution to combat climate change because it is a reliable source of low-carbon energy and can meet global energy demands efficiently.

#### **II. Main Point #1: Nuclear energy produces minimal greenhouse gases**

- **Example 1:**
   Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear power plants emit virtually no carbon dioxide during operation. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), nuclear energy has prevented over 70 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions since the 1970s.
- **Example 2:**
   Comparatively, wind and solar energy require vast amounts of land and materials, which can offset some of their carbon benefits. Nuclear energy delivers consistent power with minimal environmental impact.

#### **III. Main Point #2: Nuclear energy is reliable and scalable**

- **Example 1:**
   Unlike solar and wind, which depend on weather conditions, nuclear plants operate 24/7. They produce a consistent energy output regardless of external factors. This makes them an essential backbone of any energy grid.
- **Example 2:**
   Countries like France have successfully reduced their reliance on fossil fuels by investing heavily in nuclear energy, deriving over 70% of their electricity from nuclear power. This demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of this energy source.

#### **IV. Main Point #3: Counterargument and Rebuttal**

- **Counterargument:**
   Critics argue that nuclear energy is dangerous due to risks like accidents (e.g., Chernobyl, Fukushima) and the problem of nuclear waste disposal.
- **Rebuttal:**
   Modern nuclear plants use advanced technologies like Generation IV reactors, which are far safer and more efficient. Furthermore, nuclear waste can now be reprocessed or stored securely for long periods. The risks are vastly outweighed by the catastrophic consequences of unchecked climate change.

#### **V. Conclusion**

- **Restate Points:**
   Nuclear energy is a reliable, low-carbon, and scalable solution to combat climate change. Its benefits far exceed its risks when modern technology and strict regulations are applied.
- **Call to Action:**
   It’s time for governments and citizens to reevaluate their stance on nuclear energy. We must advocate for policies that encourage its adoption alongside renewables to secure a sustainable future for generations to come.

### Notes for the Oral

You should use the following bullet points for your notecards:

- **Introduction:**
  - Hook: "Imagine a future where clean air..."
  - Mention urgency of climate change, introduce nuclear energy.
  - Establish credibility: "I’ve spent time researching..."
  - Thesis: "Nuclear energy is the best solution..."
- **Main Point #1:**
  - Nuclear plants emit almost no CO2.
  - Prevented 70 gigatonnes of emissions since 1970s.
  - Solar/wind limitations: land use, inconsistent power.
- **Main Point #2:**
  - Operates 24/7, unlike solar/wind.
  - France's success: 70% energy from nuclear.
- **Main Point #3 (Counterargument):**
  - Critics cite safety concerns (Chernobyl/Fukushima).
  - Modern reactors = safer (Gen IV).
  - Nuclear waste manageable vs. climate risks.
- **Conclusion:**
  - Restate thesis: Reliable, low-carbon, scalable.
  - Call to action: Governments and citizens must embrace nuclear energy.

## Second Speech (in-class)

### Persuasive Speech Outline

**Topic:** Should EFREI pay its students for good grades?
 **Stance:** EFREI should reward students with monetary incentives for good grades.

#### **I. Introduction**

Hook:
 Imagine a world where your hard work, late nights, and exam stress are rewarded not just with grades but with cash in your pocket.

Context/Background:
 Education is an investment in the future, and EFREI already emphasizes academic excellence. Monetary rewards could take this motivation to the next level.

Establish Credibility**:**
 As an EFREI student, I understand the challenges we face and the effort we put into maintaining high academic standards.

Thesis:
 EFREI should reward students for good grades because it will boost motivation, improve performance, and prepare students for the realities of a results-driven world.

#### **II. Main Point #1: Boosting Motivation**

- **Example:**
   Research shows that monetary incentives significantly enhance performance and focus. According to a study in *Psychological Science*, students perform better when tangible rewards are at stake.
- **Example:**
   Many universities abroad already offer scholarships and financial perks, proving this approach works in fostering academic drive.

#### **III. Main Point #2: Improved Performance and Reputation**

- **Example:**
   Financial rewards would encourage students to push harder, leading to higher GPAs across the board. A stronger student body means better rankings for EFREI.
- **Example:**
   Universities like Stanford and MIT use various incentives, attracting top-tier talent and elevating their global reputation. EFREI can follow suit.

#### **IV. Main Point #3: Counterargument and Rebuttal**

- **Counterargument:**
   Critics may argue that monetary rewards could create unhealthy competition or devalue intrinsic motivation.
- **Rebuttal:**
   Grades are already competitive, and rewards would recognize effort rather than replace passion for learning. Moreover, students in the real world are often rewarded financially for their achievements—why not prepare them for this reality?

#### **V. Conclusion**

- **Restate Points:**
   Paying students for good grades boosts motivation, enhances performance, and aligns education with real-world incentives.
- **Call to Action:**
   EFREI should implement a reward system to encourage students to strive for excellence. Together, we can create a culture of achievement and recognition.
